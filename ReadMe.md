# MINS (fork)
Forked from: [rpng/MINS](https://github.com/rpng/MINS)

An efficient, robust, and tightly-coupled **Multisensor-aided Inertial Navigation System (MINS)** which is capable of 
flexibly fusing all five sensing modalities (**IMU**, **wheel** **encoders**, **camera**, **GNSS**, and **LiDAR**) in a filtering 
fashion by overcoming the hurdles of computational complexity, sensor asynchronicity, and intra-sensor calibration. 

Exemplary use case of MINS: 
* VINS (mono, stereo, multi-cam)
* GPS-IMU (single, multiple)
* LiDAR-IMU (single, multiple)
* wheel-IMU
* Camera-GPS-LiDAR-wheel-IMU or more combinations.
